          All I've had is coffee and leftover pie. 
          One day, I will stop falling in love with you, 
          Some day someone will like me like I like you."

            And I hope you find some peace, I let you go and I feel more like me
            I wish you well, but far away from me, Godspeed."

                                     You ruin your life, You losing your mind,You dyeing your hair,
                                     You crashing your car,You breaking your heart, You thinking I care"
